for encyrption error on windows with connecting to MongdoDB atlas, your system won't let it connect

    Download https://letsencrypt.org/certs/lets-encrypt-r3.pem 726
    rename file .pem to .cer
    double click and install
    and then try to run app your SSL issue will resolved. Cheers !!!

    certifi==2022.5.18.1 is a library that im pretty sure doesn't help the issue but some people said to try it but the first method should allow the database to connect

Migrate is a command for the database not 100% sure what it does, and it shouldn't be needed much
python manage.py migrate



Actual Set up


    need to set up a virtual enviroment in in the root folder 
        (your could also set up the virtual envirometn elsewhere)

    use    python3 -m venv venv   to make one called venv
    0r use    py -m venv venv    other ways to make a vitrial enviroment also exist

    it needs to be called venv so the gitignore recognizes it

    to activae run venv/Scripts/activate from the root folder
    you may neede to change execution policy to run Scripts
    I used the command 
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    and then I could avctive the enviroment

    once activated the command line should look like this
    (venv) PS C:\Users\chace\ ....

    then isntall django 
        py -m pip install django (other commands exist as well)
        shoul dbe able to drop the py -m part at begining
        also can use python instead of py

    Generate a requirements document
        python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt 

    initally requirements.txt contains the following libraries
        asgiref==3.5.2
        Django==4.0.4
        sqlparse==0.4.2
        tzdata==2022.1

    In react the modules folder acts similar to the virtual enviroment
    and the package.json is similar to the requirements.txt  file
    except the requirements.txt needs to be manulally generated to keep the used modules up to date

    you can install specific verison of a library/dependancy with 
        python -m pip install django==2.2.11 if you wanted a older verison of django

    If the requirements.txt already exists for example if cloning from github
    you can install all the dependancies with
        python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    make sure your virtual enviroment is activated before installing dependancies
    run this command fromthe folder containing the requirements.txt file


    creating a django project from the backend folder
    django-admin startproject api .

    python manage.py runserver

    //will need to set up apps to make it work




possibility to use poetry 
for setting up a virtual enviroment instead of pip

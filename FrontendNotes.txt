I believe you need node to create and run a react app

        generates in frontend folder
        nodemodules
        public
        scr
        gitignore
        two package .json files
*/

I might make the root folder a node app to be able to run frontend and backend at the same time or it could be done another way
We can add scripts to automate running the frontend and backend at the same time


inside fontend folder 
        npm i react-router-dom  // for routing to different pages i nthe frontend
        npm i react-icons       // to be able to use icons < https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons?name=fa >
        npm i axios             // create HTTP requests /connection to backend
        npm i react-toastify    // for error messages to display / show alerts
        npm i redux             // installs redex toolkit

    can also use    npm install <module/library>    to install a dependency

    can also use    npm install   by itself to install all dependancies found in the package.json file

    to get rid of a module
    npm uninstall <name of thing you don't want>

more dependencies will be added as you go, when you add a dependancy it automatically adds

running app 
npm run start -- in frontend folder - opends your browser

app.js contains main code
    added pages folder in src to hold different pages

I've also started by setting up a basic header and routing top differnt pages

Lots will change as we go



A little about react
https://github.com/ChaceN89/Aviar Chaces last project front end uses react to see examples if you find that useful

a basic file thats can use javascript and returns html elements
need to use <> </> to enclose everything sometimes

import React from 'react'
function header() {
  return (
    <div>header</div>  // html elemtnts top return to the caller
  )
}
export default header // export of the fucntions you want to use

in other file call <header/> like it is an html elements

you can also use CSS modules to make files contains just specific css
